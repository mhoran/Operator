This is Operator, a shared address book application for Android.

We plan to support other mobile devices some day.

Right now, we're using Google's C2DM protocol (http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/) to send messages to clients.  A similar protocol exists for iOS and Windows Phone 7.

The source for the backend server is at http://github.com/mike-burns/operatorserver.
